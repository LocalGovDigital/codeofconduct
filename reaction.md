# How we apply the code of conduct

## How we respond to reports of harassment

'As it happens' means as soon as we are notified of an incident, while the event is in progress, and at any time up until the end of the event.
'After the fact' means as soon as we are notified of an incident, after the event has officially finished.

### In person as it happens
* check to see if the complainant needs support of any kind - this can include privacy, safe space, medical attention, police to be called etc
* identify the harasser and establish if they are still at the event
* inform the harasser that there has been a complaint about their behaviour, and that the behaviour needs to stop. If they refuse, inform them that their access to the event has been revoked and they need to leave immediately.
* let the complainant know what the resolution is
 
### By email as it happens
* find the complainant and see if they need support of any kind (as above)
* carry on with steps as above 

### Over Slack as it happens
* find the complainant and see if they need support of any kind (as above)
* carry on with steps as above 

### In person after the fact
* check to see if the complainant needs support of any kind
* contact the harasser and inform them that there has been a complaint about their behaviour
* remind the harasser of the code of conduct and that they must agree to abide by it if they attend any future Local Gov Digital events
* inform the harasser that any future complaints will result in them being banned from further Local Gov Digital events

### By email after the fact
... does this need an email template? ...
* acknowledge the complaint by email and set out the steps we will take
* contact the harasser and inform them that there has been a complaint about their behaviour
* remind the harasser of the code of conduct and that they must agree to abide by it if they attend any future Local Gov Digital events
* inform the harasser that any future complaints will result in them being banned from further Local Gov Digital events

### Over Slack after the fact
... same as by emali I think - template Slack DM to complainant, and one for harasser? ...
